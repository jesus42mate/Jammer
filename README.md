### Jammer

Jammer is a tool made to quickly install software that I regularly use and need to be efficient
and my personal working tools in the terminal

Currently it is though for Ubuntu 22.04 but will eventually allow for more versions like the
24.04

Some of these are...
  - Updating (and upgrading) the apt packet manager
  - Installing NeoVim from source to the last LTS version
  - Installing NVM (Node Version Manager) and installing the latest LTS version
  - Installing Composer and PHP
  - Etc...

To use, just execute the program by running `make run` and follow the instructions
