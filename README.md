### Jammer

Jammer is a tool made to quickly install software that I regularly use and need in order to be
efficient. 

They are my personal tools and are meant for my own use, but there is a possibility that you might
also find this tool useful, if that is the case, feel free to use it.

`But remember... this tool makes changes in the system as sudo and is still experimental, try at your own risk.`

Currently it is though for Ubuntu 22.04 but will eventually allow for more versions like
24.04.

Some of these are...
  - Updating (and upgrading) the apt packet manager
  - Installing NeoVim from source to the last LTS version
  - Installing NVM (Node Version Manager) and installing the latest LTS version
  - Installing Composer and PHP
  - Etc...

To use, just execute the program by running `make run` and follow the instructions
