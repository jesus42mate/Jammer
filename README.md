### Hammer

Hammer is a tool made to quickly install software that I regularle use and need to be efficient
and my personal working tools in the terminal

Some of these are...
  - Updating (and upgrading) the apt packet manager
  - Installing NeoVim from source to the last LTS version
  - Installing NVM (Node Version Manager) and installing the latest LTS version
  - Installing Composer and PHP
  - Etc...

To use, just execute the program by running `make run` and follow the instructions
